### 🧩 Adding New Store Integrations

Unified Store Manager is designed with a modular, event-based architecture for easy extensibility! Anyone can add support for new e-commerce platforms or custom stores by building a connector module.

**Key Principles:**
- **Event-Based Architecture:** All core actions (sync, update, error, etc.) are triggered and handled via events, allowing connectors to react to platform changes and system workflows in a decoupled way.
- **Modular Connectors:** Each store integration is a self-contained module in the `connectors/` directory, implementing a standard interface and listening for relevant events.
- **Auto-Discovery:** New connectors are auto-loaded from the `connectors/` directory—no core code changes required.

**To add a new store integration:**
1. Fork the repo and clone it locally.
2. Copy the `connectors/template/` directory to a new folder (e.g., `connectors/my-store/`).
3. Implement the required event handlers and interface methods (`onProductSync`, `onOrderUpdate`, etc.).
4. Register your connector in the system (see [Connector Development Guide](docs/CONNECTOR_GUIDE.md)).
5. Write tests and update documentation.
6. Submit a pull request!

> See [docs/CONNECTOR_GUIDE.md](docs/CONNECTOR_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions and examples.
